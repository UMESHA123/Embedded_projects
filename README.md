1. Motion Detection and Alarm system  Human Motion detection with 5m range, display Motion detected message on LCD, Bluetooth  app and also indication using Buzzer and LED indicators.  USE: PIR Sensor, Bluetooth, LCD Display, Buzzer and LED Indicator  
 
2. Bluetooth Numeric printer  Simple printer application using LCD and 7 segment Display. Send HEX values from 0 to F, ASCII values of a to z and ASCII values of A to Z and print it on LCD and 7 segment display  USE: Bluetooth, 7 segment Display, LCD display

3.Motors control with Bluetooth and Push buttons  DC Motors direction control using buttons and Bluetooth app. Use each of 4 buttons for  direction control of Forward, Backward, Left, Right (robot application). Use LCD to print  direction of motor rotation in real time.  USE: 2 DC Motors, Push Buttons, Bluetooth with 4 buttons, LCD Display  

4. Ultrasonic range Detector  Detect the distance of the objects and print the sensor values in both CM and Inches on LCD  and Bluetooth App. Use Ultrasonic to detect the distance and use Buzzer and LED Indicators  when distance is &lt;5 cm. Caution should be written on LCD and Bluetooth too.  USE: Ultrasonic sensor, LCD, Bluetooth, Buzzer and LED Indicator. 

5.PIR sensor enabled Automated Relays (Without Arduino)  Without any microcontroller, use PIR sensor to detect the motion and actuate the relay for 5  minutes (tune the delay accordingly) and also a buzzer/LED indication throughout the relay  ON USE: PIR Sensor, Relay, Buzzer/LED 

6. PIR sensor enabled Automated Relays (With Arduino)  By using PIR sensor to detect the motion and actuate the relay for 5 minutes (tune the delay  accordingly) using Arduino and also send the caution messages to LCD and Bluetooth  parallelly USE: PIR Sensor, Relay, LCD, Buzzer, Bluetooth  

7. Automated Temperature controller  Displaying the Temperature data (both *C and *F) on LCD and Bluetooth app in Realtime and  whenever the temperature crosses 30*C, Actuate the relay (should be on till it will reach 25*C)  and indicate through buzzer (only 2 sec ON)  USE: LM35 temperature sensor, LCD, Relay, Bluetooth, Buzzer. 

8. IR sensor enabled UP Counter  Simple UP counter starts from 0 values and when ever the object detects, the counter value  will be incremented. Print the counter values on LCD, Bluetooth app and 7Segment display  (only up to 9)  USE: IR sensor, LCD, 7 segment display, Buzzer and LED indicator.
